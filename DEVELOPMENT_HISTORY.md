## Overview
This document tracks the complete development history of the Dashboard EPMAPS POC project, including all changes, issues resolved, and technical decisions made.

## Detailed Development Log

### 2025-09-03 - Initial POC Dashboard Creation
- Created basic Streamlit dashboard for monitoring VMs
- Integrated with AWS CloudWatch for real-time metrics
- Implemented environment switching (Production, QA, DEV)
- Added visual indicators for alarm states
- Basic CSS styling for server cards

### 2025-09-05 - AWS Integration and Deployment
- Implemented cross-account role assumption for AWS
- Created deployment scripts for AWS Fargate
- Added CloudWatch agent deployment script
- Implemented alarm creation scripts
- Added debug logging functionality

### 2025-09-10 - Major Refactoring to Class-Based Architecture
- Migrated from monolithic app.py to modular structure
- Created service classes (AWSService, SAPService)
- Created UI component classes (DashboardUI, DetailUI)
- Preserved all original functionality and appearance
- Improved code maintainability and testability

### 2025-09-12 - Header Space Optimization
- Reduced header heights in dashboard and detail pages
- Decreased h1 font size from 2.5rem to 1.8rem
- Adjusted margins and padding throughout
- Fixed navigation elements that were cut off
- Maintained all text and rotation functionality

### 2025-09-13 - Column Control Feature
- Added column selector (1-4 columns) for group distribution
- Implemented session persistence using query parameters
- Fixed column selection persistence during auto-refresh
- Fixed navigation persistence when viewing detail pages
- Aligned "Columnas:" label with dropdown control

### 2025-09-14 - Smooth Auto-Refresh Implementation
- Replaced meta refresh with st.fragment(run_every=30)
- Eliminated black screen effect during refresh
- Fixed auto-refresh not actually updating content
- Removed unnecessary manual refresh button
- Version: v0.2.06

### 2025-09-15 - Fix AWS Cache for Tag Changes (v0.2.07)

#### Problem Reported
**DashboardGroup Tag Changes Not Reflecting in UI**
- **Issue**: User modified DashboardGroup tags in EC2 console
- **Root Cause**: AWS data cached for 15 minutes (900 seconds)
- **Impact**: Users had to wait up to 15 minutes to see changes

#### Solution Applied
**Reduced Cache TTL**
- Changed from 900 seconds (15 minutes) to 60 seconds (1 minute)
- File: `services/aws_service.py:61`
- Now tag changes reflect within 1 minute

#### Technical Change
```python
@st.cache_resource(ttl=60)  # Reduced from 900 to 60 seconds
def get_cross_account_boto3_client_cached(service, role_arn=None):
```

#### Result
- âœ… Tag changes now visible within 1 minute
- âœ… Good balance between performance and data freshness
- âœ… Users can modify EC2 tags and see results quickly

### 2025-09-15 - Fix Duplicate Groups Issue (v0.2.08)

#### Problem Identified and Solved
**"Almacenamiento" Showing as Two Separate Groups**
- **Root Cause**: Extra whitespace in DashboardGroup tag values
- **Example**: "Almacenamiento" vs "Almacenamiento " (with trailing space)
- **Result**: AWS treated them as different group names

#### Solution Applied
**1. Automatic Tag Cleaning**
- Added `.strip()` to DashboardGroup values in AWS service
- Removes leading/trailing whitespace automatically
- File: `services/aws_service.py:159`

**2. Debug Process Used**
- Added temporary debug logging to identify the issue
- Found invisible characters in tag values
- Confirmed the fix worked correctly
- Removed debug code after verification

**3. Removed Unnecessary UI Elements**
- Removed the manual refresh button (user didn't request it)
- Restored original control layout

#### Technical Fix
```python
# Clean DashboardGroup value to remove extra whitespace
dashboard_group = tags.get('DashboardGroup', 'Uncategorized').strip()
```

#### Result
- âœ… All three "Almacenamiento" servers now appear in single group
- âœ… Future tag changes will automatically be cleaned
- âœ… No more duplicate groups due to whitespace
- âœ… 1-minute cache for good performance/freshness balance

#### Version: v0.2.08

### 2025-09-16 - Port 80 Preparation
- Confirmed application ready for port 80 deployment
- Fargate deployment script already configures ALB on port 80
- No code changes required

### 2025-09-17 - CloudFront Compatibility (v0.2.09)
- Analyzed WebSocket limitations with CloudFront
- Created CloudFront deployment script
- Added compatibility headers in dashboard_manager.py
- Documented deployment process
- Application works correctly with WebSocket fallbacks

### 2025-09-17 - Navigation and Threading Issues Resolved
- Fixed empty label warning with label_visibility="hidden"
- Removed threading approach causing ScriptRunContext warnings
- Improved auto-refresh reliability

#### Pending Work
- Additional server card indicators for technical diagnostics
- Performance metrics display (CPU, Memory, Disk)
- Uptime and connectivity status indicators

#### Current Status: v0.2.11
All major issues resolved, smooth auto-refresh working, column control functional, tag grouping fixed, and alarm report added.

### 2025-09-18 - Add PREVENTIVA to Yellow Alarms and CloudFront Support (v0.2.10)

#### Changes Made
**1. Extended Yellow Alarm Detection**
- Added "PREVENTIVA" to the list of keywords that trigger yellow alarms
- Now alarms are yellow when state is ALARM and name contains:
  - "ALERTA"
  - "PROACTIVA" 
  - "PREVENTIVA" (new)
- Updated in:
  - `services/aws_service.py:149`
  - `ui_components/detail_ui.py:177`

**2. CloudFront Deployment Support (v0.2.09)**
- Created `ScriptsUtil/create_cloudfront_distribution.sh` for easy CloudFront deployment
- Added CloudFront compatibility headers in `dashboard_manager.py`
- Documented deployment process in `docs/cloudfront_deployment.md`
- Application now works correctly behind CloudFront with WebSocket fallbacks

#### Technical Details
```python
# Yellow alarm detection now includes PREVENTIVA
if alarm_state == 'ALARM' and ('ALERTA' in alarm_name.upper() or 
                               'PROACTIVA' in alarm_name.upper() or 
                               'PREVENTIVA' in alarm_name.upper()):
    instance_alarms['PREVENTIVE'] += 1
```

#### Result
- âœ… Alarms with "PREVENTIVA" in name now show as yellow
- âœ… Application ready for CloudFront deployment
- âœ… Port 80 support confirmed via Fargate ALB

### 2025-09-18 - Add Global Alarm Report Page (v0.2.11)

#### New Feature: Global Alarm Report
**Requirements Implemented:**
1. New alarm report page accessible via link below dashboard title
2. Report shows comprehensive alarm statistics per instance

#### Technical Implementation:
1. **New Component**: `ui_components/alarm_report_ui.py`
   - Processes alarm data and categorizes by type
   - Detects disk count from alarm naming patterns
   - Color-codes rows based on alarm severity
   - Provides CSV export functionality

2. **Dashboard Updates**:
   - Added "ðŸ“Š Reporte Alarmas" link below title in `dashboard_ui.py:199-202`
   - Link navigates to `?alarm_report=true`
   - Preserves environment selection across pages

3. **Routing Updates**: `dashboard_manager.py`
   - Added alarm report route handling
   - Integrated AlarmReportUI component

#### Features:
- âœ… Summary metrics at top (total instances, alarms by type)
- âœ… Sortable/filterable data table
- âœ… Row highlighting based on alarm severity
- âœ… CSV export with timestamp
- âœ… Consistent navigation with main dashboard
- âœ… No sidebar menu as requested

## Technical Architecture

### Current Structure
```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                    # Main entry point (uses DashboardManager)
â”œâ”€â”€ dashboard_manager.py      # Central coordinator
â”œâ”€â”€ services/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ aws_service.py       # AWS integration
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ sap_service.py       # SAP monitoring
â”œâ”€â”€ ui_components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dashboard_ui.py      # Main dashboard
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ detail_ui.py         # Server detail page
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ alarm_report_ui.py   # Alarm report page
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ helpers.py           # Shared utilities
â””â”€â”€ components/              # Legacy components (preserved)
```

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Modular Architecture**: Separated concerns into service and UI layers
2. **State Management**: Used Streamlit session state and query params
3. **Caching Strategy**: 60-second TTL for AWS data freshness
4. **Auto-refresh**: st.fragment for smooth updates without page reload
5. **No Sidebar**: Clean navigation through links and buttons only
